<h1>Sea Battle</h1>
<p>
    This is a command-line game called Sea Battle written in C++. It took 5
    months to build and allows you to play against CPU.
</p>
<h2>Game Overview</h2>
<p>
    At the start of the game, you set your ground and ship orientation. If you
    don't like this orientation of ships, you can press 1 and the game will
    create another random ground with the same ships but in different places and
    orientations. Once you are okay with the new ground, you can proceed to the
    next menu where you can buy things like air defense, bomber, fighter, radar,
    and more. You have a random amount of money to spend and must choose what to
    buy with your money. You can view the aircraft information before making a
    purchase and there is a short demonstration of each item.
</p>
<p>
    After you have purchased your equipment, you can go to the "advanced
    settings" and access features like becoming rich, showing your opponent's
    ground, or letting the opponent only play. Be sure to check there! You can
    then confirm the layout and start playing the game.
</p>
<p>
    In the game menu, you will see your ground and ships on the left and your
    opponent's hidden ground on the right. You can use the equipment that you
    purchased in the last menu by selecting "use equipment" and then selecting
    what you want to use. A description of how to use the equipment will appear
    on the bottom of the page when you select it. If you destroy part of your
    opponent's ship, you gain an additional round and can play again. If you
    cannot hit your opponent's ship, your opponent will play. The opponent does
    not have any equipment.
</p>
<p>
    If you run out of equipment or do not want to use it, you can bomb one block
    of your opponent's ground. After successfully sinking a ship, meaning every
    block of the ship gets hit, the ship and blocks next to it will become
    revealed. You cannot hit reveal blocks twice. The game base (ground) for you
    and your opponent is 10x10. The first player to destroy every ship of the
    other player wins.
